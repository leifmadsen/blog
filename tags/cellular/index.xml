      <description>I was interviewed at the Wind Mobile launch a couple of months ago, and was interviewed by an online publication. I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember which online publication it was, so had forgotten all about it until I noticed someone had posted a link to it in the on-asterisk mailing list. Enjoy!
