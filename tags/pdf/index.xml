      <description>Check out http://leifmadsen.com and click on the presentations tab. Under that tab you will find my presentations from AstriCon 2010, &rsquo;5 Things You Didn&rsquo;t Know Asterisk Could Do&rsquo; and a slightly updated version of my &lsquo;Building Distributed Queue Systems&rsquo; presentation. Both are in PDF format.
Both presentations went over extremely well, and I think both probably ended up being, or nearly being, my best presentations ever given. In previous years I&rsquo;ve given presentations on distributed Asterisk systems and last year at IT360 I gave my &rdquo;5 Things You Didn&rsquo;t Know Asterisk Could Do&rdquo; presentation, so perhaps being somewhat familiar with the format helped.</description>
