      <description>I have a client who I need to connect to via a Cisco VPN, and since I use Ubuntu as my primary OS on my MacBook Pro, I&amp;rsquo;ve often needed to find some information about how to get the client working.
I had previously found some information about patching on Ubuntu 9.04 and it worked great, but since updating to 9.10 I had the same compile time issues I had before, which makes sense since the kernel is different now.</description>
