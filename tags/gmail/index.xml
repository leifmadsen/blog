      <description>Today I had the need to start relaying mail through my Google Apps account since Super-Evil-Bastard-ITSPRogers blocks sending email (it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good thing, however it&amp;rsquo;s quite annoying when running some services from home).
Found this article while Googling, and it worked great first try. I like when things are this easy.

      <description>Today I was working on the next edition of the Asterisk book and wanted to see if I could get Asterisk IMAP voicemail support to work with Gmail. I had tried doing this a few times in the past without success, but since I had spent some time documenting and testing against Dovecot last week for another client and gotten everything working, I figured I had a good base to start trying to connect to the Gmail IMAP servers.</description>
