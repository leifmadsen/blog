      <description>Check out http://leifmadsen.com and click on the presentations tab. Under that tab you will find my presentations from AstriCon 2010, &amp;rsquo;5 Things You Didn&amp;rsquo;t Know Asterisk Could Do&amp;rsquo; and a slightly updated version of my &amp;lsquo;Building Distributed Queue Systems&amp;rsquo; presentation. Both are in PDF format.
Both presentations went over extremely well, and I think both probably ended up being, or nearly being, my best presentations ever given. In previous years I&amp;rsquo;ve given presentations on distributed Asterisk systems and last year at IT360 I gave my &amp;rdquo;5 Things You Didn&amp;rsquo;t Know Asterisk Could Do&amp;rdquo; presentation, so perhaps being somewhat familiar with the format helped.</description>

      <description>NOTE: My presentations are available on my website at http://leifmadsen.com under the Presentations tab.
Hey all! I&amp;rsquo;m at AstriCon 2010 in Maryland and it&amp;rsquo;s going great so far! Russell Bryant and I spoke with several keen users and developers last night in the Code Zone at a fairly late hour, which shows just how dedicated Asterisk users are. There was pretty much no one else around and we had a room of about 20-30 people just having a great discussion about Asterisk development.</description>
