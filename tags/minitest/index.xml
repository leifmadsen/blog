      <description>So for the last week or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been tasked at CoreDial with adding our own set of integration testing now that we&amp;rsquo;re moving to a more formal deployment method using chef. After much pestering of questions to thehar of Lookout Mobile Security and with help of Google, #chef and jhansche in #jenkins I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got a nice clean proof of concept that we can evaluate and likely deploy.
I&amp;rsquo;ll come back later with another article on my installation issues with jenkins and the solutions that I solved (nothing too terribly complicated), but what I wanted to blog about was the two types of tests that I&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on and was able to finally solve.</description>
