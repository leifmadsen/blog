      <description>In case you missed it, I wrote an introductory article about the Asterisk Test Suite on the Asterisk blog. The post takes you from a minimally installed Ubuntu 9.10 up to the point that you can run the tests in the test suite by going through all the possible errors you might encounter getting it loaded, and how to resolve those errors (most of them being missing dependencies).
Enjoy!

      <description>Here is a post I came across from my twitter feed discussing why NDAs are essentially useless and unenforceable in the digital age. Many good points are made, and for the most part I agree with them. I&amp;rsquo;m not quite so vehemently opposed to them as the author is as I know they aren&amp;rsquo;t enforceable. The reason I sign them is a good faith gesture to my clients. I think we both know they aren&amp;rsquo;t useful, but it gives the client a nice litmus test to determine whether I&amp;rsquo;m just looking to steal ideas, or at least to say, &amp;ldquo;Hey, it&amp;rsquo;d be great if you didn&amp;rsquo;t twitter or blog about anything you learn while looking at our system.</description>
