      <description>Today I was working on a system, and knowing that the system is going to get moved, and that often one of the things forgotten is to update the externaddr= option in sip.conf (when Asterisk is sitting behind NAT), I decided to put together a little script that returns the external IP address of the system. Using this script along with an #exec in the sip.conf file will make it so the address gets updated when the system is moved to the new physical location.</description>
