      <description>I just have to write up a quick post to show you JUST HOW SIMPLE it is to get interesting events from your PBX via Jabber. Right now I&rsquo;m using it to notify me of anyone trying out my test ISN number, or whenever they join my conference bridge (good reminder if I lose track of time and forget that I scheduled some people to join my conference room). This is based on Asterisk 1.4, although the same configuration should work on 1.6, but I like to try and give 1.4 examples where I can for those of you still running 1.4.</description>
