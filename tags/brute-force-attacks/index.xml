      <description>Recently (over the weekend and continuing into today) there have been several attacks from Amazon EC2 hosts running scanners looking for open SIP accounts. I&rsquo;ve gathered a couple of links that I think are useful in knowing more about the attacks, along with methods of stopping the attacks. The Joshua Stein blog has a very clever way of stopping the attacks that impressed me.

Update (2010/04/18): It seems the story has made it at least as far as Slashdot now.</description>
