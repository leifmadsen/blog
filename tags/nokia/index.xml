      <description>There was some talk in one of the IRC chat rooms today about someone trying to get their E61i working with Asterisk. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had an issue getting that phone or my E71 phone working, but regardless he was having issues. I figured I might as well spend a little bit of time today going through my configuration, both for my own reference, and so that other people can get their Nokia&amp;rsquo;s setup with Asterisk as well.</description>
