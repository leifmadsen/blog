      <description>Just another quick update on the progress of the 3rd edition of the Asterisk book. It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit slow coming, but Jim and I have renewed vigor andÂ vigilance to be productive and get things done. Since the last update, there was a period of time where nothing got done unfortunately. We did get a lot done in the week off I took to focus on the book (I think we ended up writing about 2-3 new chapters, and updated a lot of the old ones), but then of course work got in the way.</description>

      <description>Jim and I have been working feverishly for the past few days, and the only thing that can cure it is more cowbell! Or probably more accurately, more writing!
We&amp;rsquo;ve been making some good progress on rewriting a couple of chapters so far, and tweaking a few other ones. We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of finishing up the first drafts of the new installation chapter and the initial configuration chapter, and I&amp;rsquo;ve started work on a chapter about queues.</description>

      <description>As many of you know, I&amp;rsquo;m a co-author of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony. While my girlfriend is away in Mexico for a week with the girls, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and focus a bunch of attention on getting A:TFoT 3rd edition started (which is much overdue).
If you have any ideas for topics you would like covered in the new edition, or something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t covered as heavily as you wanted in the 1st and 2nd editions, feel free to let me know, and your ideas will be considered!</description>

      <description>I have vowed to try and write at least ONE article per week on my blog, even if it is quite short. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I will be able to get to write an article this week due to some pressing consulting issues, but I&amp;rsquo;m still gonna try. If anything, I&amp;rsquo;m going to cheat and say this is my post for this week. How about I make a rule that says I can only cheat once per month?</description>
