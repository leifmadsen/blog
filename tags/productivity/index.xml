      <description>The following is an interesting article about not tracking workers time spent at work, or on vacation, but rather tracking their productivity. As a consultant who doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a fixed set of hours in the day that I work, I tend to judge my productivity by the number of hours I get to bill each week (i.e. how productive was I working for customers, rather than playing Flight Simulator :)). I haven&amp;rsquo;t tracked actual holidays for years now (since I started consulting full time out of school in 2003), and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I ever had a job long enough prior to school that I received any sorts of benefits of holidays.</description>

      <description>Russell Bryant just sent me a link to a neat site that allows you to do online collaborative mind mapping: MindMeister. If you&amp;rsquo;re not aware of what mind mapping software does, it is a method to quickly and easily allow you to brainstorm ideas without getting in the way too much. It works by starting from a central node and breaking out in lines from there where you start with an idea or thought, then break that thought down further with additional lines from that node.</description>
