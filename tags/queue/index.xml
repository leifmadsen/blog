      <description>_UPDATE (October 7, 2009):
This post didn&amp;rsquo;t quite generate the type of questions I was hoping for, and because of that I&amp;rsquo;m not able to generate a knowledgeable and informed response that would be overtly useful. However, I will leave this topic open for the next little while in the hopes some more questions can be generated. It is entirely possible I haven&amp;rsquo;t been specific enough in my request for the type of questions I&amp;rsquo;d like to answer, so here goes.</description>

      <description>I have vowed to try and write at least ONE article per week on my blog, even if it is quite short. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I will be able to get to write an article this week due to some pressing consulting issues, but I&amp;rsquo;m still gonna try. If anything, I&amp;rsquo;m going to cheat and say this is my post for this week. How about I make a rule that says I can only cheat once per month?</description>
