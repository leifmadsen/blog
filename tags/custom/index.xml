      <description>The other day I was talking to my friend Russell Bryant who pointed me to some .bashrc magic that would show me which branch I was currently working with inside a git repo on my system. I found it incredibly handy and have modified the ANSI colour coding slightly. export PS1='[\u@\h \[33[0;36m\]\W$(__git_ps1 &quot;\[33[0m\]\[33[0;33m\](%s)&quot;)\[33[0m\]]\$ ' On Fedora Russell mentioned that you need the bash-completion installed. We&rsquo;re unsure if you need anything on other distributions.</description>
