      <description>_UPDATE (October 7, 2009):
This post didn&amp;rsquo;t quite generate the type of questions I was hoping for, and because of that I&amp;rsquo;m not able to generate a knowledgeable and informed response that would be overtly useful. However, I will leave this topic open for the next little while in the hopes some more questions can be generated. It is entirely possible I haven&amp;rsquo;t been specific enough in my request for the type of questions I&amp;rsquo;d like to answer, so here goes.</description>

      <description>Edit: I have updated the original post, which contained &amp;lsquo;custom&amp;rsquo; field name in the database instead of &amp;lsquo;userfield&amp;rsquo; which is a field Asterisk-Stat uses. Edit2: Updated the field from &amp;lsquo;amaflag&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;amaflags&amp;rsquo; thanks to Justin. Edit3: Updated the script based on feedback from Mads Peter Nielsen and Gabriel. Thanks!
 Today I had a client that had a need to run some statistical analysis on their data, but since they didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything like that developed, I had to go on a search to find them something.</description>
