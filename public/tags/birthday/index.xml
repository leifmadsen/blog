      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having found an article about the Commodore 64 turning 30 this year, I reflected back in a comment on that page about what it is like to be only 1 year older than the Commodore 64, a computer which spiked my interest in technology away from a games system to something much more. The original article is available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/commodor-64-30-year&#34;&gt;http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/commodor-64-30-year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I just turned 31 a couple of days ago on January 7th, and when I was in grade 2 (about 8-9 years old I guess) I started getting interested in the Commodore 64s we had at our school that were plentiful, but rarely used. I remember the first thing the teacher taught me; $p$g&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Commodore 64 replaced my interest with Nintendo (which I still have) to a greater interest that shaped me and caused me to grow technologically.  This grew into the Packard Bell &lt;sup&gt;486&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; my parents bought where I played flight simulator (after my Dad purchased more RAM for the computer at $100 a MB), and ran a BBS (the first month I played around with the 2400 baud modem calling Las Vegas BBS numbers that a friends father gave me; I lived in Sarnia, ON, Canada which is north-east of Detroit), and eventually ran my own BBS. Running a BBS gave me the sense of community that I possess and the love of telecommunications that is my career to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So thank you Commodore for your C64 which has allowed me to carve out my career and greatly influenced who I am; and not just professionally.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
