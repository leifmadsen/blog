      <description>So last night I did a system update between 11:30pm and 5:00am. One of the things I forgot to do when I was moving to the new system was to install sox so that MixMonitor() could mix the -in and -out files automatically for me. I still had the recordings, but I needed to get them mixed. I first installed sox so that all new recorded files would be mixed for me.</description>
