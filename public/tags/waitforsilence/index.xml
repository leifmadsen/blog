      <description>A funny thing happened today. Fred Posner posted an article about telemarketer torture (here). He has some examples that his script created.
It was funny because today I worked on almost the exact same thing. My implementation was a bit different, but I really like the approach he took too. We both ended up using the WaitForSilence() application.
Mine should be available via ISN 666*460 if you wanna try it out.</description>
