      <description>And I found the Cooking With Asterisk presentation as well! Apologies for the low quality on the video (as this one has a lot more text than the Distributed Call Centre video), but you can follow along with the presentation on your screen as available on my website at:

      <description>Check out the AstriCon website for my presentation that was recorded this year. I did three presentations this year (5 Things You Didn&rsquo;t Know Asterisk Could Do, Distributed Call Centres, and the Asterisk Project Update with Russell Bryant) but unfortunately the only one I see so far is the 5 Things presentation (which is a very good presentation! :))
The link to the presentations are here: http://www.astricon.net/videoPresentations.aspx#Digium7 with mine being at the top of the list.</description>

      <title>My Presentations from AstriCon 2010 are Available</title>

      <description>Check out http://leifmadsen.com and click on the presentations tab. Under that tab you will find my presentations from AstriCon 2010, &rsquo;5 Things You Didn&rsquo;t Know Asterisk Could Do&rsquo; and a slightly updated version of my &lsquo;Building Distributed Queue Systems&rsquo; presentation. Both are in PDF format.
Both presentations went over extremely well, and I think both probably ended up being, or nearly being, my best presentations ever given. In previous years I&rsquo;ve given presentations on distributed Asterisk systems and last year at IT360 I gave my &rdquo;5 Things You Didn&rsquo;t Know Asterisk Could Do&rdquo; presentation, so perhaps being somewhat familiar with the format helped.</description>

Hey all! I&rsquo;m at AstriCon 2010 in Maryland and it&rsquo;s going great so far! Russell Bryant and I spoke with several keen users and developers last night in the Code Zone at a fairly late hour, which shows just how dedicated Asterisk users are. There was pretty much no one else around and we had a room of about 20-30 people just having a great discussion about Asterisk development.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone!
Sorry for the lack of updates recently. We&rsquo;ve been hard at work on the next version of the Asterisk book, which is shaping up to be the best book ever written on Asterisk. The scope and detail we&rsquo;re working towards is ambitious, but will be very much worth it. Of course the book will be focused on the upcoming Asterisk 1.8 releases (which was recently branched and betas are now available for testing!</description>

      <description>So AstriCon 2010 has been officially announced (although the information for where and when it was going to be held has been on the http://www.astricon.net site for a bit now &ndash; perhaps contracts have been signed now?), and they are soliciting for speaker topics due for May 1st. I&rsquo;ve either attended, spoken, or assisted with every AstriCon since 2004 (the first one!) and I&rsquo;m looking forward to submitting another talk for this year.</description>

      <description>For those who missed it, you&rsquo;re able to get a PDF of my AstriCon 2009 presentation from the http://www.astricon.net website.

There are additional presentations available from the conference as well. Check them out here: http://www.astricon.net/2009/astricon/agendaAtaGlance.aspx
Overall, the conference was extremely well attended and I had a great time. I&rsquo;ve been to a lot of conferences, and AstriCon is definitely a premiere conference that is professionally run, and contains a great deal of useful information by well versed presenters with little fluff (i.</description>
