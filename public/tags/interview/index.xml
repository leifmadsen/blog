&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/jenspeedy&#34;&gt;@jenspeedy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.yourhome.ca&#34;&gt;http://www.yourhome.ca&lt;/a&gt; interviewed my fiancée and I about our recently purchased townhouse in Caledon after our designer &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.twitter.com/melissadavis&#34;&gt;@melissadavis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melissadavis.ca&#34;&gt;http://www.melissadavis.ca&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.designerfriend.ca&#34;&gt;http://www.designerfriend.ca&lt;/a&gt; recommended she speak to us. Danielle (my fiancée) and I had a pretty good idea about the items we wanted for our new townhouse build, but were looking for a designer to make sure we didn&amp;rsquo;t get too far off track, and to steer us into the direction we ultimately wanted to achieve, while not breaking the bank (i.e. we didn&amp;rsquo;t need someone to hand hold us, or to do the actual implementation; we just needed someone to do some floor plans and give us some ideas on furniture based on our tastes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article describes the process we took about keeping prices within a reasonable range while at the same time getting almost everything we wanted out of our home, knowing it&amp;rsquo;d be a medium-term house for us until we eventually scale up to something a bit larger in the future (like when we have kids, etc&amp;hellip;). Our thoughts are we&amp;rsquo;ll be there anywhere from 5-7 years, so obviously we want to make sure there are some items that help us enjoy our home while we live there, while giving good resale value in the future, but not installing frivolous items that aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily worth it for a home we won&amp;rsquo;t be in for 20+ years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the article because it&amp;rsquo;s awesome ;)   &lt;a href=&#34;http://yourhome.ca/homes/realestate/buyingahome/article/795438--long-term-shopping-list-helps-couple-furnish-caledon-townhouse&#34;&gt;http://yourhome.ca/homes/realestate/buyingahome/article/795438&amp;ndash;long-term-shopping-list-helps-couple-furnish-caledon-townhouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our article is part of a larger set of articles too, so check those out as well:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://ow.ly/1z1us&#34;&gt;http://ow.ly/1z1us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: Check out this table we bought on the weekend based on style recommendations by Melissa Davis! She gave us a &amp;lsquo;shopping list&amp;rsquo; of items so we can get a feel for things that all go together. When we saw this table, I saw it and liked it quite a bit. I saw the price, and thought &amp;ldquo;wow, that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good price!&amp;rdquo;. As we walked around the store looking for sofas, I kept coming back to it, and we both liked it so much we decided to buy it! Just remember not to be stuck on exactly what is on the list, because the purpose is to give you a feel for the type of pieces that would go together, but be sure to give it some of your own character!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interview from Wind Mobile launch</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was interviewed at the Wind Mobile launch a couple of months ago, and was interviewed by an online publication. I didn&amp;rsquo;t remember which online publication it was, so had forgotten all about it until I noticed someone had posted a link to it in the on-asterisk mailing list. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wind Mobile launches with contract-free, unlimited plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Globalive&amp;rsquo;s Wind Mobile brand is officially live in Toronto and will soon be opening its doors in Calgary and other Canadian cities. The company&amp;rsquo;s pricing plans target some of the most disliked aspects of existing cell phone companies&amp;rsquo; practices.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, Suzanne Bowen of DIDX recently interviewed co-author of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony and good friend of mine, Jim van Meggelen. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never had a chance to see Jim speak at a conference, do yourself a favour and try to attend one of his sessions. He is extremely entertaining and informative, and is always a joy to speak to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim also talks about the much anticipated 3rd edition of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the interview of Jim van Meggelen by Suzanne Bowen here:  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.didx.net/podcast/?p=episode&amp;amp;name=2009-11-19_jimvanm.mp3&#34;&gt;http://www.didx.net/podcast/?p=episode&amp;amp;name=2009-11-19_jimvanm.mp3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
