      <description>Howdy folks, Sorry for the lack of updates lately. I&rsquo;ve recently (December 2012) started at Thinking Phone Networks as the Lead UC Systems Engineer, and we&rsquo;ve been incredibly busy there. In addition, the authors and I had been working on the final touches to the 4th edition of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide, which documents Asterisk 11 LTS. Late last week, the book went to print, and should start to appear on store shelves and start shipping from Amazon and other locations within the next 6-8 weeks I believe.</description>

      <description>Today we marked the finishing of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition) by sending the first draft off to the O&rsquo;Reilly production team. We finished nearly on schedule (within a few days, which is remarkable considering we added 150 more pages than originally intentioned) and have our favourite copy editor Rachel Head (formerly Wheeler) who did the first edition of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony who we emphatically enjoyed working with.</description>

      <description>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve done an update on my blog, but that&rsquo;s just because we&rsquo;ve been so busy at work on the next edition of the O&rsquo;Reilly published Asterisk book! Asterisk: The Definitive Guide is the next update to the Asterisk: The Future Of Telephony books and is thus the 3rd edition. We&rsquo;ve changed the name for two reasons: 1) This is pretty much a complete re-write of the book based on Asterisk 1.8 and 2) Asterisk is no longer the FUTURE of telephony; it&rsquo;s the present.</description>

      <description>Jim and I have been working feverishly for the past few days, and the only thing that can cure it is more cowbell! Or probably more accurately, more writing! We&rsquo;ve been making some good progress on rewriting a couple of chapters so far, and tweaking a few other ones. We&rsquo;re in the process of finishing up the first drafts of the new installation chapter and the initial configuration chapter, and I&rsquo;ve started work on a chapter about queues.</description>

      <description>As many of you know, I&rsquo;m a co-author of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony. While my girlfriend is away in Mexico for a week with the girls, I&rsquo;m going to try and focus a bunch of attention on getting A:TFoT 3rd edition started (which is much overdue). If you have any ideas for topics you would like covered in the new edition, or something that wasn&rsquo;t covered as heavily as you wanted in the 1st and 2nd editions, feel free to let me know, and your ideas will be considered!</description>

      <description>Today I had the privilege to be interviewed by Suzanne Bowen of DIDX. You can find the interview at http://www.didx.net/podcast/?p=episode&amp;name=2009-07-30_leifmadsenjul312009.mp3 Hope you enjoy! Here is a description of the interview: &ldquo;Truth is that I &ldquo;met&rdquo; the authors of the book &ldquo;Asterisk, the Future of Telephony&rdquo; when I was an English teacher and had volunteered over email to help edit the documentation. It was a joy to interview Leif Madsen. The Asterisk rockstar* shares with us the history of how he became interested in voice, telephony, Asterisk and open source.</description>
