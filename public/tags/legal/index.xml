      <description>Here is a post I came across from my twitter feed discussing why NDAs are essentially useless and unenforceable in the digital age. Many good points are made, and for the most part I agree with them. I&rsquo;m not quite so vehemently opposed to them as the author is as I know they aren&rsquo;t enforceable. The reason I sign them is a good faith gesture to my clients. I think we both know they aren&rsquo;t useful, but it gives the client a nice litmus test to determine whether I&rsquo;m just looking to steal ideas, or at least to say, &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;d be great if you didn&rsquo;t twitter or blog about anything you learn while looking at our system.</description>
