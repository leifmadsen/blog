      <description>And I found the Cooking With Asterisk presentation as well! Apologies for the low quality on the video (as this one has a lot more text than the Distributed Call Centre video), but you can follow along with the presentation on your screen as available on my website at:

      <description>Just a quick update that the Asterisk Cookbook is complete! We&amp;rsquo;ll be releasing it under a Creative Commons license (just like Asterisk: The Definitive Guide) again. It&amp;rsquo;ll be a 24 recipe e-book right now, with it growing over time and eventually becoming a full print edition once the size warrants it. Of course if you purchase now you help spur on additional incentive to continue making it larger. I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that you also continue to receive updates automatically as the book grows and corrections are made (which sounds pretty cool!</description>

      <description>In case you missed it, Russell Bryant wrote a blog post on debugging the Asterisk dialplan with the Verbose() application. This is one of the recipes that will be features in the upcoming Asterisk Cookbook that we&amp;rsquo;re writing, and hoping to have done by the end of March!
(In case you&amp;rsquo;ve missed all the cool stuff lately, the Asterisk Cookbook will also be released under the same Creative Commons license as the previous Asterisk books.</description>

      <description>After finishing the first draft of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition), I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit antsy with wanting to do some more writing. After about a week of a break (i.e. sleeping in past 7am for the first time in nearly a year), Russell Bryant and I have decided to team up on delivering the long awaited Asterisk Cookbook.
To start off with, we&amp;rsquo;ll be writing a short, 80-100 page eBook that will be distributed by O&amp;rsquo;Reilly in all the formats they support (http://oreilly.</description>
