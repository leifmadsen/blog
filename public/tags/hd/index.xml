      <description>Today Russell Bryant and I had the first public HD conference using Asterisk! There had been other testing done by Malcolm Davenport and David Vossel (who is the developer working on this integration) internally, but this was the first public HD enabled conference using Asterisk (as far as I&amp;rsquo;m aware). It worked really well! People were able to join in, and those who were calling in via G722 were able to hear each other in wideband, while the other people in the conference who were using narrowband codecs like GSM and ulaw didn&amp;rsquo;t hear any difference in the audio from the participants.</description>
