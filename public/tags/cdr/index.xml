      <description>Edit: I have updated the original post, which contained &lsquo;custom&rsquo; field name in the database instead of &lsquo;userfield&rsquo; which is a field Asterisk-Stat uses. Edit2: Updated the field from &lsquo;amaflag&rsquo; to &lsquo;amaflags&rsquo; thanks to Justin. Edit3: Updated the script based on feedback from Mads Peter Nielsen and Gabriel. Thanks! Today I had a client that had a need to run some statistical analysis on their data, but since they didn&rsquo;t have anything like that developed, I had to go on a search to find them something.</description>
