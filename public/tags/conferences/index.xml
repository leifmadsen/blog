      <description>NOTE: My presentations are available on my website at http://leifmadsen.com under the Presentations tab. Hey all! I&rsquo;m at AstriCon 2010 in Maryland and it&rsquo;s going great so far! Russell Bryant and I spoke with several keen users and developers last night in the Code Zone at a fairly late hour, which shows just how dedicated Asterisk users are. There was pretty much no one else around and we had a room of about 20-30 people just having a great discussion about Asterisk development.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! Sorry for the lack of updates recently. We&rsquo;ve been hard at work on the next version of the Asterisk book, which is shaping up to be the best book ever written on Asterisk. The scope and detail we&rsquo;re working towards is ambitious, but will be very much worth it. Of course the book will be focused on the upcoming Asterisk 1.8 releases (which was recently branched and betas are now available for testing!).</description>
