      <description>I think the best quote I heard the entire time came from @abalashov (Alex Balashov) during the AstriDevCon when we were talking about Asterisk documentation, and how we might better organize it within the source.
We were discussing perhaps moving some of the existing configuration file examples to a manpage, and Alex piped up to say, &amp;ldquo;Manpages are a vestige of our glorious, prehensile, curly-tailed past.&amp;rdquo;
There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much left to be said after that :)</description>
