      <description>Today we marked the finishing of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition) by sending the first draft off to the O&rsquo;Reilly production team. We finished nearly on schedule (within a few days, which is remarkable considering we added 150 more pages than originally intentioned) and have our favourite copy editor Rachel Head (formerly Wheeler) who did the first edition of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony who we emphatically enjoyed working with.</description>

      <description>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve done an update on my blog, but that&rsquo;s just because we&rsquo;ve been so busy at work on the next edition of the O&rsquo;Reilly published Asterisk book!
