      <description>Today I had a need to go and load a bunch of registrations into Asterisk for a bug I was working on. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve had this need a couple of times now, and I keep going and having to redevelop it, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just write about it here, and then when I need it again, I can just look it up. Maybe this will be useful for someone else as well.</description>
