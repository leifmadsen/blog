      <description>Check out the AstriCon website for my presentation that was recorded this year. I did three presentations this year (5 Things You Didn&rsquo;t Know Asterisk Could Do, Distributed Call Centres, and the Asterisk Project Update with Russell Bryant) but unfortunately the only one I see so far is the 5 Things presentation (which is a very good presentation! :))
The link to the presentations are here:Â http://www.astricon.net/videoPresentations.aspx#Digium7 with mine being at the top of the list.</description>
