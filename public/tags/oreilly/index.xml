      <description>Howdy folks,
Sorry for the lack of updates lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently (December 2012) started at Thinking Phone Networks as the Lead UC Systems Engineer, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been incredibly busy there. In addition, the authors and I had been working on the final touches to the 4th edition of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide, which documents Asterisk 11 LTS.
Late last week, the book went to print, and should start to appear on store shelves and start shipping from Amazon and other locations within the next 6-8 weeks I believe.</description>

      <description>After finishing the first draft of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition), I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit antsy with wanting to do some more writing.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve done an update on my blog, but that&amp;rsquo;s just because we&amp;rsquo;ve been so busy at work on the next edition of the O&amp;rsquo;Reilly published Asterisk book! Asterisk: The Definitive Guide is the next update to the Asterisk: The Future Of Telephony books and is thus the 3rd edition. We&amp;rsquo;ve changed the name for two reasons: 1) This is pretty much a complete re-write of the book based on Asterisk 1.</description>
