      <description>I was interviewed at the Wind Mobile launch a couple of months ago, and was interviewed by an online publication. I didn&rsquo;t remember which online publication it was, so had forgotten all about it until I noticed someone had posted a link to it in the on-asterisk mailing list. Enjoy! Wind Mobile launches with contract-free, unlimited plans Globalive&rsquo;s Wind Mobile brand is officially live in Toronto and will soon be opening its doors in Calgary and other Canadian cities.</description>
