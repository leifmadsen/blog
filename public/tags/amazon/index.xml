      <description>At CoreDial we&rsquo;ve been using a lot of AWS EC2 lately for building sandbox infrastructure for testing. Part of the infrastructure is a voice platform utilizing Asterisk 1.4 and 1.8, and those voice platforms are using Zaptel and DAHDI respectively for use with MeetMe(). This hasn&rsquo;t been an issue previously as our testing has either been on bare metal, or in other virtual machine systems where installation of a base image and standard kernel are not an issue.</description>

      <title>Recent SIP Attacks from Amazon EC2</title>

      <description>Recently (over the weekend and continuing into today) there have been several attacks from Amazon EC2 hosts running scanners looking for open SIP accounts. I&rsquo;ve gathered a couple of links that I think are useful in knowing more about the attacks, along with methods of stopping the attacks. The Joshua Stein blog has a very clever way of stopping the attacks that impressed me. http://jcs.org/notaweblog/2010/04/11/properly_stopping_a_sip_flood http://www.voiptechchat.com/voip/457/amazon-ec2-sip-brute-force-attacks-on-rise/ http://www.stuartsheldon.org/blog/2010/04/sip-brute-force-attack-originating-from-amazon-ec2-hosts/ Update (2010/04/18): It seems the story has made it at least as far as Slashdot now.</description>
