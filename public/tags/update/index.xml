      <description>On this day in 2005, LeifMadsen Enterprises, Inc. was formally registered as an incorporation by the government of Canada! I&amp;rsquo;ve now been consulting on Asterisk professionally for over 6 years full time (and a few years before that!). I graduated from the telecommuncations technology program at Sheridan Institute of Technology in 2004. In that time I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken at every AstriCon since 2004 (the first one), and have helped write 4 books on the subject of Asterisk (The Future of Telephony 1st, 2nd editions, The Definitive Guide 3rd edition, Cookbook).</description>

      <description>Jim and I have been working feverishly for the past few days, and the only thing that can cure it is more cowbell! Or probably more accurately, more writing!
We&amp;rsquo;ve been making some good progress on rewriting a couple of chapters so far, and tweaking a few other ones. We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of finishing up the first drafts of the new installation chapter and the initial configuration chapter, and I&amp;rsquo;ve started work on a chapter about queues.</description>

      <description>Just a quick note letting you know I&amp;rsquo;m back from vacation! Just been working on catching up on a few things, and have started working on a new article. It will be focusing on how to convert from using AgentCallbackLogin() to using the AddQueueMember() method of dynamically adding members to queues. Since AgentCallbackLogin() has been removed from Asterisk 1.6.0 and beyond, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use the AddQueueMember() method.
Luckily, all the tools we need to use it on Asterisk 1.</description>
