      <title>Create a virtual undercloud with TripleO Quickstart</title>

      <description>In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how I&amp;rsquo;m currently using TripleO Quickstart to instantiate a virtual machine on a remote virtual machine host from my workstation. In follow up blog posts I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how to utilize the virtual machine to provision both virtual and baremetal overclouds from the virtual machine.
Topology The topology for our lab environment is shown in image 1-1.
 Image 1-1: TripleO Quickstart Physical Layout   We have a laptop acting as the workstation (where we&amp;rsquo;ll do our work from), a virtual host (with lots of memory to run virtual machines), and 3 small physical hosts (Atom based) which will simulate nodes for a baremetal deployment.</description>

      <title>Create network bridge with nmcli for libvirt</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to get libvirt working properly with bridged networking, we first need
to configure our local network to have network bridge slaved to our wired
ethernet adapter. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to set this up too often (as once I do, it just
sits there running happily). Here are some basic steps I did to get this going
locally.

      <title>TripleO: Using the fake_pxe driver with Ironic</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on testing things with TripleO and normally I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-quickstart/&#34;&gt;TripleO
Quickstart&lt;/a&gt; to spin things up
in a virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often when doing NFV work though, you need things that can&amp;rsquo;t be used in a
virtual environment (such as DPDK, SR-IOV, etc) so you need some baremetal
nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my home lab environment though, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the luxury of IPMI, so I need
to make use of the &lt;code&gt;fake_pxe&lt;/code&gt; driver in Ironic, which allows for standard PXE
control, but requires you to deal with powering on and off the machines
manually. Let me show you how I make use of that.

      <title>TripleO: Consuming Composable Roles</title>
      <link>http://blog.leifmadsen.com/blog/2016/10/03/tripleo-consuming-composable-roles/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So last week I started to look into learning the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://hardysteven.blogspot.ca/2016/08/tripleo-composable-services-101.html&#34;&gt;composable services and
roles&lt;/a&gt;
that was added to Newton. I previously learned a little bit about deploying
OpenStack clouds when I did training after joining Red Hat, but that was based
on Liberty, and a lot has changed in TripleO since that time.

The first thing was learning what composable services and roles are, and
generally what they are intended to solve. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into that
here, so I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to go read some links first and then come back here.
Additionally, it&amp;rsquo;s assumed you know what a TripleO is :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
