      <description>It&rsquo;s been way too long since I&rsquo;ve blogged. And this post isn&rsquo;t going to be all the impressive unfortunately. However, I recently have been running a BBS and some friends and I have been playing LORD. We&rsquo;ve been playing this for the last few months, and I think I&rsquo;m going to run a tournament. Perhaps with some sort of buy in like $10 or something, winner takes all. Going to build it out in such a way that first person to beat the dragon 3 times will win the game, and at that point that person will win the pot.</description>

      <description>Today I received a couple of phones from Digium; the D40 and D70. I&rsquo;ll be using these phones for testing and documentation in the 4th edition of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (which Jim Van Meggelen, Russell Bryant and myself are working on right now). Here is my unboxing of the phones and some commentary about my initial impressions of the hardware itself. [caption id=&ldquo;attachment_484&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo;] Pretty boxes![/caption] Phones arrived in some nice looking boxes.</description>

      <description>So I ran into something kind of stupid today :) Adding a little note for anyone who might run into a similar instance. I have some ssh-add stuff that gets run in my .bashrc file, but when I was outputting it, I was doing: ssh-add ~/.ssh/some_key &gt; /dev/null 2&amp;&gt;1 Note the 2&amp;&gt;1 at the end. That means to redirect output to a file named 1. You need to flip the</description>

      <title>Commodore 64 Turns 30 This Year</title>

      <description>Having found an article about the Commodore 64 turning 30 this year, I reflected back in a comment on that page about what it is like to be only 1 year older than the Commodore 64, a computer which spiked my interest in technology away from a games system to something much more. The original article is available at http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/commodor-64-30-year &ldquo;I just turned 31 a couple of days ago on January 7th, and when I was in grade 2 (about 8-9 years old I guess) I started getting interested in the Commodore 64s we had at our school that were plentiful, but rarely used.</description>

      <title>#AstriCon 2011 Quote of the Conference (@abalashov)</title>
      <link>http://blog.leifmadsen.com/blog/2011/10/30/</link>

      <guid>http://blog.leifmadsen.com/blog/2011/10/30/</guid>
      <description>I think the best quote I heard the entire time came from @abalashov (Alex Balashov) during the AstriDevCon when we were talking about Asterisk documentation, and how we might better organize it within the source. We were discussing perhaps moving some of the existing configuration file examples to a manpage, and Alex piped up to say, &ldquo;Manpages are a vestige of our glorious, prehensile, curly-tailed past.&rdquo; There wasn&rsquo;t much left</description>

      <title>Connecting two conferences on initial join (with cleanup)</title>

      <description>Update 2011/12/15: Updated the code to deal with a couple of people joining at about the same time by using GROUP() and GROUP_COUNT(). Additionally updated the &lsquo;h&rsquo; extension which was missing some code For the last week or so at work, people have been saying, &ldquo;Hey, I can&rsquo;t join the conference call this morning because I&rsquo;m driving but I can&rsquo;t call into the conference room on that server&rdquo;. There are really a couple solutions to the problem, 1) everyone should use the conference room that is accessible via the PSTN, 2) get the IT staff to allow PSTN access to the internal conference room.</description>

      <description>On this day in 2005, LeifMadsen Enterprises, Inc. was formally registered as an incorporation by the government of Canada! I&rsquo;ve now been consulting on Asterisk professionally for over 6 years full time (and a few years before that!). I graduated from the telecommuncations technology program at Sheridan Institute of Technology in 2004. In that time I&rsquo;ve spoken at every AstriCon since 2004 (the first one), and have helped write 4 books on the subject of Asterisk (The Future of Telephony 1st, 2nd editions, The Definitive Guide 3rd edition, Cookbook).</description>

      <description>With the end of maintenance for the Asterisk 1.4 (the previous long term support (LTS) release) and Asterisk 1.6.2 (the previous standard, short term support release) branches, the time to look at using Asterisk 1.8 (the next long term support release, which provides another 4 years of maintenance, followed by a year of security support) is upon us. For those who have successful deployments of Asterisk 1.4 and 1.6.2 (heck, even 1.2!) there is no immediate need to migrate those existing systems; let them happily continue what they’re doing.</description>

      <description>After finishing the first draft of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition), I&rsquo;ve been a bit antsy with wanting to do some more writing. After about a week of a break (i.e. sleeping in past 7am for the first time in nearly a year), Russell Bryant and I have decided to team up on delivering the long awaited Asterisk Cookbook. To start off with, we&rsquo;ll be writing a short, 80-100 page eBook that will be distributed by O&rsquo;Reilly in all the formats they support (http://oreilly.com/ebooks/).</description>

      <description>Today we marked the finishing of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition) by sending the first draft off to the O&rsquo;Reilly production team. We finished nearly on schedule (within a few days, which is remarkable considering we added 150 more pages than originally intentioned) and have our favourite copy editor Rachel Head (formerly Wheeler) who did the first edition of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony who we emphatically enjoyed working with.</description>

      <description>Here is the response I got from VIA Rail for a lost ticket, which was printed off at the time of departure for my return trip. Why they insist on printing the return ticket the time of departure I don&rsquo;t know, but how ridiculous is this? &ldquo;VIA Rail will not issue a free ticket against a lost or stolen ticket being reported. Customers are required to purchase a new ticket at the original fare and complete a Lost Ticket Indemnity Bond.</description>

      <description>Recently, @jenspeedy of http://www.yourhome.ca interviewed my fiancée and I about our recently purchased townhouse in Caledon after our designer @melissadavis of http://www.melissadavis.ca and http://www.designerfriend.ca recommended she speak to us. Danielle (my fiancée) and I had a pretty good idea about the items we wanted for our new townhouse build, but were looking for a designer to make sure we didn&rsquo;t get too far off track, and to steer us into the direction we ultimately wanted to achieve, while not breaking the bank (i.e.</description>

      <description>Recently I&rsquo;ve been playing around with a couple of technologies that I haven&rsquo;t used in quite a while; ENUM and ISN. First, a little information on what these technologies are about. ISNs and ITADs First, lets talk about ISN (ITAD Subscriber Number) and ITAD (Internet Telephony Administrative Domain). I think the http://www.freenum.org website does a good job of succinctly describing the problem attempting to be addressed: &ldquo;The Freenum/ISN system is 12-digit-keypad (telephone handset) friendly method of providing mapping between users.</description>
