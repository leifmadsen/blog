      <description><p>So last week I started to look into learning the new <a href="http://hardysteven.blogspot.ca/2016/08/tripleo-composable-services-101.html">composable services and
roles</a>
that was added to Newton. I previously learned a little bit about deploying
OpenStack clouds when I did training after joining Red Hat, but that was based
on Liberty, and a lot has changed in TripleO since that time.

The first thing was learning what composable services and roles are, and
generally what they are intended to solve. I don&rsquo;t want to get into that
here, so I&rsquo;d encourage you to go read some links first and then come back here.
Additionally, it&rsquo;s assumed you know what a TripleO is :)</p></description>
