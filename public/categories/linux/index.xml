      <description>In order to get libvirt working properly with bridged networking, we first need to configure our local network to have network bridge slaved to our wired ethernet adapter. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to set this up too often (as once I do, it just sits there running happily). Here are some basic steps I did to get this going locally.
Add a bridge interface via Network Manager Before we get to adding a new network interface to libvirt, we&amp;rsquo;ll add our bridge interface to our host system via Network Manager.</description>

      <title>TripleO: Consuming Composable Roles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So last week I started to look into learning the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://hardysteven.blogspot.ca/2016/08/tripleo-composable-services-101.html&#34;&gt;composable services and
roles&lt;/a&gt;
that was added to Newton. I previously learned a little bit about deploying
OpenStack clouds when I did training after joining Red Hat, but that was based
on Liberty, and a lot has changed in TripleO since that time.

The first thing was learning what composable services and roles are, and
generally what they are intended to solve. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into that
here, so I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to go read some links first and then come back here.
Additionally, it&amp;rsquo;s assumed you know what a TripleO is :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Console Obsession</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s A Console Thing Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten into running as many of my day-to-day applications in a Linux console. Thought I&amp;rsquo;d briefly share the applications I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with.
 GerTTY (http://gertty.readthedocs.io/en/master/): Synchronize and follow Gerrit-hosted projects, and perform code reviews. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit slow, but generally works pretty well once you get over the initial sync.
More Info: https://major.io/2016/05/11/getting-started-gertty/
 Weechat (https://weechat.org/): IRC client with tiling-window manager like options.</description>
