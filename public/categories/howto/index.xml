      <description>In scene 1b, we&amp;rsquo;ll continue with our work from the Building the virtual Cobbler deployment and get a kickstart file loaded into Cobbler. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be mostly reviewing the kickstart file itself, and not really getting into how to manage the Cobbler process itself (that&amp;rsquo;s left as an exercise for the reader).
The main thing to note is that this is a bit of a work in progress, and I know there are a few things that could be enhanced (for example, in the Cobbler configuration file you can set a secret that you can reference as a variable in the kickstart file, but I&amp;rsquo;m not doing that here, and you could also setup partitioning, etc).</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this scene I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how I&amp;rsquo;ve built out a local Cobbler deployment into
my virtual host in order to bootstrap the operating system onto my baremetal
nodes via kickstart files and PXE booting.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The yakLab is a place where yaks are electronically instantiated for the
purpose of learning and documenting. The lab consists of a virtualization host
(virthost) which has 64GB of memory and hosts all the virtual machines,
primarily for infrastructure.
