      <description>There are always a few things I need to do to get libvirt working with a non-root user on Fedora that I need to do, and typically results in some Google researching. Here are some notes of what I recently did to get my libvirt setup going on a new Fedora 25 installation and working with a non-root user.
NOTE I found this tuxfixer blog post while doing some other research for this blog post, which basically does everything I&amp;rsquo;m about to say, but he does some other network setup and things I&amp;rsquo;d have done via nmcli and the console.</description>
