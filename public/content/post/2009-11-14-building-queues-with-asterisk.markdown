Wow it's been a long time since I've update my blog. Well, lets do that! :)

I've just posted some documentation to the Asterisk issue tracker for review. It's about building queues with Asterisk. It is the start of probably 2 or 3 sets of documentation on building queues with Asterisk that I'll be submitting. You can find the documentation here for now:

[https://issues.asterisk.org/view.php?id=16237](https://issues.asterisk.org/view.php?id=16237)

This documentation will likely be merged into core Asterisk at some point in the near future (doc/ subdirectory of your Asterisk source) and likely posted on [http://blogs.asterisk.org](http://blogs.asterisk.org) as well.

Check it out, and let me know if you find any spelling errors, documentation errors, anything that isn't clear, or errors in the examples. Of course suggestions for future documentation to be written would also be welcomed.

Thanks!
