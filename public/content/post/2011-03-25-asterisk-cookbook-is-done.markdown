Just a quick update that the Asterisk Cookbook is complete! We'll be releasing it under a Creative Commons license (just like Asterisk: The Definitive Guide) again. It'll be a 24 recipe e-book right now, with it growing over time and eventually becoming a full print edition once the size warrants it. Of course if you purchase now you help spur on additional incentive to continue making it larger. I've been told that you also continue to receive updates automatically as the book grows and corrections are made (which sounds pretty cool!).
