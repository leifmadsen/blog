For those who missed it, you're able to get a PDF of my AstriCon 2009 presentation from the [http://www.astricon.net](http://www.astricon.net) website.

There are additional presentations available from the conference as well. Check them out here:Â  [http://www.astricon.net/2009/astricon/agendaAtaGlance.aspx](http://www.astricon.net/2009/astricon/agendaAtaGlance.aspx)

Overall, the conference was extremely well attended and I had a great time. I've been to a lot of conferences, and AstriCon is definitely a premiere conference that is professionally run, and contains a great deal of useful information by well versed presenters with little fluff (i.e. sales pitches). I met a bunch of great people there who are quite intelligent, and hope to keep in contact with them.

If you're looking for conferences to budget for next year, definitely keep AstriCon on your short list.
