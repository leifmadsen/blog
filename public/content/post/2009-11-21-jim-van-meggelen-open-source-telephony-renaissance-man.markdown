In case you missed it, Suzanne Bowen of DIDX recently interviewed co-author of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony and good friend of mine, Jim van Meggelen. If you've never had a chance to see Jim speak at a conference, do yourself a favour and try to attend one of his sessions. He is extremely entertaining and informative, and is always a joy to speak to.

Jim also talks about the much anticipated 3rd edition of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony.
