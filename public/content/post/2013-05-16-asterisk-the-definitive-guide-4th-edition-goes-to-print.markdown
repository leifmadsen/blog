Howdy folks,

Sorry for the lack of updates lately. I've recently (December 2012) started at Thinking Phone Networks as the Lead UC Systems Engineer, and we've been incredibly busy there. In addition, the authors and I had been working on the final touches to the 4th edition of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide, which documents Asterisk 11 LTS.

Late last week, the book went to print, and should start to appear on store shelves and start shipping from Amazon and other locations within the next 6-8 weeks I believe. However, if you've purchased the digital version, it's already available!

I got mine from O'Reilly, and sync'd it to my Dropbox and shared it with my co-workers. There are usually deals around on Amazon and the O'Reilly website that will let you purchase both the digital and printed versions. The digital should be available immediately, with the printed version shipping as soon as it's available.

Thanks to everyone who helped make the 4th edition a success, and to get it done in the last 8 months! It's been quite the journey since the 1st edition was released in 2005.
