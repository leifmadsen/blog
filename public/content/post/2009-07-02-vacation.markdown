Well it's finally happened; I'm going on vacation! I will be out of the office from July 3rd through the 12th. I will be working on those articles I promised last week once I return. Unfortunately I had some big projects I had to get completed before I left, which ended up leaving zero time for writing. Hopefully once I return though everything won't be backed up so much that I have to wait another week to write something.

Happy Asterisking!
