      <description>&lt;p&gt;This page documents and provides bullets about the way to approach (or avoid)
building products. These are lessons we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from previous encounters and
which we wish to avoid in the future. By sticking firmly to these development
rules, we avoid getting bogged down in complete system rearchitectures in the
future. The means to a scaled end is to approach the first customer as all your
customers.
