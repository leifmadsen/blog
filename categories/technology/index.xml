      <description>Tip: If your Brother printer won&rsquo;t print after installing the drivers, install glibc.i686
Today ran into an issue with my new Brother MFC-7460DN (which is a really nice laser printer with auto-feed scanner, Scan-to-FTP which creates a PDF file, and other things). I had just recently done a clean install of Fedora 17, and I could install the RPMs (which are i386 files on my x86_64 based system), add the printer to CUPS and all sorts of things that looked fine.</description>

      <title>CentOS 5.8 On AWS EC2 With Xen Kernel (PVGRUB)</title>

      <description>At CoreDial we&rsquo;ve been using a lot of AWS EC2 lately for building sandbox infrastructure for testing. Part of the infrastructure is a voice platform utilizing Asterisk 1.4 and 1.8, and those voice platforms are using Zaptel and DAHDI respectively for use with MeetMe(). This hasn&rsquo;t been an issue previously as our testing has either been on bare metal, or in other virtual machine systems where installation of a base image and standard kernel are not an issue.</description>

      <title>.bashrc trick for git repo and branch information</title>

      <description>The other day I was talking to my friend Russell Bryant who pointed me to some .bashrc magic that would show me which branch I was currently working with inside a git repo on my system. I found it incredibly handy and have modified the ANSI colour coding slightly.
export PS1='[\u@\h \[33[0;36m\]\W$(__git_ps1 &quot;\[33[0m\]\[33[0;33m\](%s)&quot;)\[33[0m\]]\$ '  On Fedora Russell mentioned that you need the bash-completion installed. We&rsquo;re unsure if you need anything on other distributions.</description>

      <title>Relaying SMTP via Gmail (or Google Apps) Using Postfix</title>

      <description>Today I had the need to start relaying mail through my Google Apps account since Super-Evil-Bastard-ITSPRogers blocks sending email (it&rsquo;s probably a good thing, however it&rsquo;s quite annoying when running some services from home).
Found this article while Googling, and it worked great first try. I like when things are this easy.

      <title>Initial impressions of qemu-kvm (virtualization server)</title>

      <description>The qemu-kvm (http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) package on Ubuntu 10.10 allows you to create virtual machines much like VMware, Xen, etc.
My initial impressions are generally pretty positive. I like that it lets you install multiple operating systems (including MS Windows, which I haven&rsquo;t tried yet), and doesn&rsquo;t use a web interface like VMware Server 2 (which I&rsquo;ve found to be terribly crash prone, requiring a restart of the web interface at the least, and sometime the entire server needs to be restarted, often abruptly with the kill application).</description>

      <description>After finishing the first draft of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition), I&rsquo;ve been a bit antsy with wanting to do some more writing. After about a week of a break (i.e. sleeping in past 7am for the first time in nearly a year), Russell Bryant and I have decided to team up on delivering the long awaited Asterisk Cookbook.
To start off with, we&rsquo;ll be writing a short, 80-100 page eBook that will be distributed by O&rsquo;Reilly in all the formats they support (http://oreilly.</description>

      <title>New headset thanks to e4voip.com!</title>

      <guid>http://blog.leifmadsen.com/blog/2010/02/22/new-headset-thanks-to-e4voip.com/</guid>
      <description>Just got my new Plantronics headset from http://www.e4voip.com (or rather, the hardware store at http://www.8774e4voip.com/) and am extremely satisfied with the service. We had an issue with Purolator not wanting to deliver to the building and then not bothering to call me to let me know the address was incorrect. By the time I noticed and got the address corrected, they just decided to send back the package.
So after letting the guys at e4VoIP know what happened, they just drop shipped a headset via FedEx overnight and I had it by lunch the next day!</description>

      <description>I was interviewed at the Wind Mobile launch a couple of months ago, and was interviewed by an online publication. I didn&rsquo;t remember which online publication it was, so had forgotten all about it until I noticed someone had posted a link to it in the on-asterisk mailing list. Enjoy!
Wind Mobile launches with contract-free, unlimited plans
Globalive&rsquo;s Wind Mobile brand is officially live in Toronto and will soon be opening its doors in Calgary and other Canadian cities.</description>

      <title>Why NDAs are Useless</title>
      <link>http://blog.leifmadsen.com/blog/2009/12/09/why-ndas-are-useless/</link>

      <description>Here is a post I came across from my twitter feed discussing why NDAs are essentially useless and unenforceable in the digital age. Many good points are made, and for the most part I agree with them. I&rsquo;m not quite so vehemently opposed to them as the author is as I know they aren&rsquo;t enforceable. The reason I sign them is a good faith gesture to my clients. I think we both know they aren&rsquo;t useful, but it gives the client a nice litmus test to determine whether I&rsquo;m just looking to steal ideas, or at least to say, &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;d be great if you didn&rsquo;t twitter or blog about anything you learn while looking at our system.</description>

      <title>Cisco VPN Client on Ubuntu Karmic 9.10</title>

      <description>I have a client who I need to connect to via a Cisco VPN, and since I use Ubuntu as my primary OS on my MacBook Pro, I&rsquo;ve often needed to find some information about how to get the client working.
I had previously found some information about patching on Ubuntu 9.04 and it worked great, but since updating to 9.10 I had the same compile time issues I had before, which makes sense since the kernel is different now.</description>

      <description>Recently I&rsquo;ve been noticing a lot more use of QR codes around the internet. A QR code is those 2D matrices that look like a bar code, but aren&rsquo;t just the ordinary vertical lines that you would see on your box of cereal. These are a box that contain pixels that have been coded to contain information about pretty much anything. I&rsquo;ve been seeing some people using them for contact information, web links, and pretty much anything you can think of to distribute information.</description>

      <description>Today I had the privilege to be interviewed by Suzanne Bowen of DIDX.
You can find the interview at http://www.didx.net/podcast/?p=episode&amp;name=2009-07-30_leifmadsenjul312009.mp3
Hope you enjoy!
Here is a description of the interview:
&ldquo;Truth is that I &ldquo;met&rdquo; the authors of the book &ldquo;Asterisk, the Future of Telephony&rdquo; when I was an English teacher and had volunteered over email to help edit the documentation. It was a joy to interview Leif Madsen. The Asterisk rockstar* shares with us the history of how he became interested in voice, telephony, Asterisk and open source.</description>
