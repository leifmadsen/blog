      <title>Configuring powerline to show working Git branch</title>

      <description>So the documentation for PowerlineÂ kind of sucks. I followed this pretty good article on getting started with it. First thing I noticed however is that the if statement on the article doesn&amp;rsquo;t work if you don&amp;rsquo;t have powerline installed (which kind of defeats the purpose of having the if statement there at all).
# if powerline is installed, then use it command -v powerline-daemon &amp;amp;&amp;gt;/dev/null if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then powerline-daemon -q POWERLINE_BASH_CONTINUATION=1 POWERLINE_BASH_SELECT=1 .</description>

      <description>So I ran into something kind of stupid today :) Adding a little note for anyone who might run into a similar instance.
I have some ssh-add stuff that gets run in my .bashrc file, but when I was outputting it, I was doing:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/some_key &amp;gt; /dev/null 2&amp;amp;&amp;gt;1  Note the 2&amp;amp;&amp;gt;1 at the end. That means to redirect output to a file named 1. You need to flip the &amp;amp;&amp;gt; into &amp;gt;&amp;amp;, so the fixed version looks like:</description>

      <title>Converting multiple exten =&gt; lines to using same =&gt; in Asterisk dialplan</title>

      <description>Last week I wanted to start changing some 1.4 based Asterisk dialplan to a 1.8 based Asterisk system, and in that process wanted to convert lines like:
exten =&amp;gt; _NXXNXXXXXX,1,NoOp() exten =&amp;gt; _NXXNXXXXXX,2,GotoIf($[...]?reject,1) exten =&amp;gt; _NXXNXXXXXX,3,Dial(SIP/foo/${EXTEN}) ...  into using the same =&amp;gt; prefix:
exten =&amp;gt; _NXXNXXXXXX,1,NoOp() same =&amp;gt; n,GotoIf($[...]?reject,1) same =&amp;gt; n,Dial(SIP/foo/${EXTEN})  In order to do that, Mike King helped me out with the following regular expressing which I used in vim:</description>

      <description>Today I was using the VMware vCenter Converter application to build a VM from a physical machine so that I could replace Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS with VMware ESXi (and move the functionality that the server is performing now to a VM instead of it being the base OS).
Because my server is colocated in a friends rack, and the bandwidth is shared, I needed to limit the rate at which the data was being sent from the colocated server to the virtual machine server.</description>

      <title>Return just PID of script with &#39;ps&#39; and &#39;awk&#39;</title>

      <description>Today I ran into an issue where I am running a python script that I needed to get the process ID (PID) of, but that the process was being output with a space between &amp;lsquo;python&amp;rsquo; and the actual script name (in this case, jiraircbot.py).
I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;s totally overkill and there is a much easier way I didn&amp;rsquo;t find to do this, but after some scouring of The Google, I found something that works!</description>

      <title>Set() and Goto() on same line</title>

      <description>(Thanks to Jared Smith for answering my question in IRC which is the inspiration for this post.)
Typically when I write dialplan, primarily in the case where I&amp;rsquo;m using a pattern match, I&amp;rsquo;ll save the dialed extension to a channel variable using Set(), then do a Goto() where the call logic is handled. The Set() is so that I don&amp;rsquo;t lose the value of ${EXTEN} throughout the dialplan process, especially if I&amp;rsquo;m using other mechanics such as GoSub() and others.</description>

      <description>Update 2011/12/15: Updated the code to deal with a couple of people joining at about the same time by using GROUP() and GROUP_COUNT(). Additionally updated the &amp;lsquo;h&amp;rsquo; extension which was missing some code
 For the last week or so at work, people have been saying, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I can&amp;rsquo;t join the conference call this morning because I&amp;rsquo;m driving but I can&amp;rsquo;t call into the conference room on that server&amp;rdquo;. There are really a couple solutions to the problem, 1) everyone should use the conference room that is accessible via the PSTN, 2) get the IT staff to allow PSTN access to the internal conference room.</description>

      <description>Here is a little dialplan snippet I wrote this morning for the next edition of the Asterisk book. While I&amp;rsquo;m not going to delve into all the aspects of setting up res_calendar like we do in the book, I thought for those of you who might already have this working might enjoy it.
(The calendaring modules are available in Asterisk 1.8, which is currently in release candidate status. Check out http://www.</description>

      <title>MindMeister: Online mind mapping</title>

      <description>Russell Bryant just sent me a link to a neat site that allows you to do online collaborative mind mapping: MindMeister. If you&amp;rsquo;re not aware of what mind mapping software does, it is a method to quickly and easily allow you to brainstorm ideas without getting in the way too much. It works by starting from a central node and breaking out in lines from there where you start with an idea or thought, then break that thought down further with additional lines from that node.</description>

      <description>I recently had a client request that I communicate with a webservice via SOAP in order to do some credit card authorization for an Asterisk project they were implementing. After a couple of days of reading several posts I found via Google (which funny enough weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly what I was looking for, but gave me JUST enough information to finally start putting it all together), I had something that worked.</description>
