      <description><p>So last week I started to look into learning the new <a href="http://hardysteven.blogspot.ca/2016/08/tripleo-composable-services-101.html">composable services and
roles</a>
that was added to Newton. I previously learned a little bit about deploying
OpenStack clouds when I did training after joining Red Hat, but that was based
on Liberty, and a lot has changed in TripleO since that time.</p>

      <description>It&rsquo;s A Console Thing Recently I&rsquo;ve gotten into running as many of my day-to-day applications in a Linux console. Thought I&rsquo;d briefly share the applications I&rsquo;ve been playing with. GerTTY (http://gertty.readthedocs.io/en/master/): Synchronize and follow Gerrit-hosted projects, and perform code reviews. It&rsquo;s a bit slow, but generally works pretty well once you get over the initial sync. More Info: https://major.io/2016/05/11/getting-started-gertty/ Weechat (https://weechat.org/): IRC client with tiling-window manager like options. Can split the window into various buffers in either horizontal or vertical arrangements.</description>
