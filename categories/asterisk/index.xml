      <title>Asterisk Docker Container: Phase 1</title>

      <description>AstriCon At AstriCon 2015 this year, there was a lot (and I mean a lot) of discussion around microservices (Docker), and what effort is required over the next year by the development community in order to make Asterisk better suited to running in that environment. One of the first things is, clearly, to have a container image that Asterisk runs in. I&rsquo;ve done this a few times now, but having something that can be passed over to the official Asterisk Git repository, and which everyone can contribute to, utilize and play with would be the goal here.</description>

      <description>We have a small system running in AWS as a CentOS 7 image. It has a few containers that we&rsquo;re using to host a few Golang API proxies. We migrated a customers API proxy that was running on the local VM into a container, and spun it up. Upon testing, we ran into the following error: x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided We get that failure when trying to connect to an HTTPS endpoint (remote API that we&rsquo;re proxying to Asterisk).</description>

      <description>Today I received a couple of phones from Digium; the D40 and D70. I&rsquo;ll be using these phones for testing and documentation in the 4th edition of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (which Jim Van Meggelen, Russell Bryant and myself are working on right now). Here is my unboxing of the phones and some commentary about my initial impressions of the hardware itself. [caption id=&ldquo;attachment_484&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo;] Pretty boxes![/caption] Phones arrived in some nice looking boxes.</description>

      <description>Last week I wanted to start changing some 1.4 based Asterisk dialplan to a 1.8 based Asterisk system, and in that process wanted to convert lines like: exten =&gt; _NXXNXXXXXX,1,NoOp() exten =&gt; _NXXNXXXXXX,2,GotoIf($[...]?reject,1) exten =&gt; _NXXNXXXXXX,3,Dial(SIP/foo/${EXTEN}) ... into using the same =&gt; prefix: exten =&gt; _NXXNXXXXXX,1,NoOp() same =&gt; n,GotoIf($[...]?reject,1) same =&gt; n,Dial(SIP/foo/${EXTEN}) In order to do that, Mike King helped me out with the following regular expressing which I used</description>

      <description>As of January 3rd, I&rsquo;m now working with the CoreDial team full time. I&rsquo;ve worked with them as a consultant on their infrastructure over the last few years but now will be spending significantly more time working with the engineering team :) From the announcement, “_CoreDial is pleased to announce the addition of Leif Madsen to the CoreDial team,” said Alan Rihm, CEO at CoreDial. “Leif is a well known Asterisk consultant who specializes in distributed telephony deployments and database integration.</description>

      <description>And I found the Cooking With Asterisk presentation as well! Apologies for the low quality on the video (as this one has a lot more text than the Distributed Call Centre video), but you can follow along with the presentation on your screen as available on my website at: http://leifmadsen.com/sites/default/files/AstriCon%202011%20-%20Cooking%20With%20Asterisk.pdf The video presentation is available here: http://www.tmcnet.com/tmc/videos/default.aspx?vid=5741&amp;title=Cooking+with+Asterisk#</description>

      <description>I think the best quote I heard the entire time came from @abalashov (Alex Balashov) during the AstriDevCon when we were talking about Asterisk documentation, and how we might better organize it within the source. We were discussing perhaps moving some of the existing configuration file examples to a manpage, and Alex piped up to say, &ldquo;Manpages are a vestige of our glorious, prehensile, curly-tailed past.&rdquo; There wasn&rsquo;t much left</description>

      <description>I&rsquo;ll be speaking at AstriCon today (and tomorrow) about building a distributed call centre. The presentation will be 35 minutes long and will contain a set of slides that moves you from an existing traditional PBX system up through a distributed model (which happens to use a call centre as the example system). A PDF of the presentation along with the configuration files from the demo will be available on my website after the presentation.</description>

      <description>I recently asked on twitter how many people would be interested in a set of blog posts that focused on how to use the various dialplan functions in Asterisk, and I got quite a positive response. I posted that shortly before getting married, and now that I&rsquo;m back into the groove of things, I&rsquo;m going to take a shot at posting a bunch of content focused around Asterisk dialplan functions. If you don&rsquo;t know what Asterisk dialplan functions are, head on over to the online version of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (3rd edition) (or buy it) and read the section on dialplan functions.</description>

      <description>In case you missed it, the next version of Asterisk is now in beta, and at the same time, has undergone a minor version numbering scheme. As it is unlikely that Asterisk will ever have a 2.0 release since for years now, that has generally meant Asterisk would undergo a major underlying change in both how it was programmed and the user experience (and since it would be a major disruption to the Asterisk community), it was deemed unnecessary to utilize the 1.</description>

      <description>(Thanks to Jared Smith for answering my question in IRC which is the inspiration for this post.) Typically when I write dialplan, primarily in the case where I&rsquo;m using a pattern match, I&rsquo;ll save the dialed extension to a channel variable using Set(), then do a Goto() where the call logic is handled. The Set() is so that I don&rsquo;t lose the value of ${EXTEN} throughout the dialplan process, especially if I&rsquo;m using other mechanics such as GoSub() and others.</description>

      <description>Update 2011/12/15: Updated the code to deal with a couple of people joining at about the same time by using GROUP() and GROUP_COUNT(). Additionally updated the &lsquo;h&rsquo; extension which was missing some code For the last week or so at work, people have been saying, &ldquo;Hey, I can&rsquo;t join the conference call this morning because I&rsquo;m driving but I can&rsquo;t call into the conference room on that server&rdquo;. There are really a couple solutions to the problem, 1) everyone should use the conference room that is accessible via the PSTN, 2) get the IT staff to allow PSTN access to the internal conference room.</description>
