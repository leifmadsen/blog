      <description>In order to get libvirt working properly with bridged networking, we first need to configure our local network to have network bridge slaved to our wired ethernet adapter. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to set this up too often (as once I do, it just sits there running happily). Here are some basic steps I did to get this going locally.
Add a bridge interface via Network Manager Before we get to adding a new network interface to libvirt, we&amp;rsquo;ll add our bridge interface to our host system via Network Manager.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on testing things with TripleO and normally I use TripleO Quickstart to spin things up in a virtual environment.
Often when doing NFV work though, you need things that can&amp;rsquo;t be used in a virtual environment (such as DPDK, SR-IOV, etc) so you need some baremetal nodes.
In my home lab environment though, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the luxury of IPMI, so I need to make use of the fake_pxe driver in Ironic, which allows for standard PXE control, but requires you to deal with powering on and off the machines manually.</description>

      <title>TripleO: Consuming Composable Roles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So last week I started to look into learning the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://hardysteven.blogspot.ca/2016/08/tripleo-composable-services-101.html&#34;&gt;composable services and
roles&lt;/a&gt;
that was added to Newton. I previously learned a little bit about deploying
OpenStack clouds when I did training after joining Red Hat, but that was based
on Liberty, and a lot has changed in TripleO since that time.

The first thing was learning what composable services and roles are, and
generally what they are intended to solve. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into that
here, so I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to go read some links first and then come back here.
Additionally, it&amp;rsquo;s assumed you know what a TripleO is :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
