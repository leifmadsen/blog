      <description>I&rsquo;ve been working on testing things with TripleO and normally I use TripleO Quickstart to spin things up in a virtual environment.
Often when doing NFV work though, you need things that can&rsquo;t be used in a virtual environment (such as DPDK, SR-IOV, etc) so you need some baremetal nodes.
In my home lab environment though, I don&rsquo;t have the luxury of IPMI, so I need to make use of the fake_pxe driver in Ironic, which allows for standard PXE control, but requires you to deal with powering on and off the machines manually.</description>

      <description><p>So last week I started to look into learning the new <a href="http://hardysteven.blogspot.ca/2016/08/tripleo-composable-services-101.html">composable services and
roles</a>
that was added to Newton. I previously learned a little bit about deploying
OpenStack clouds when I did training after joining Red Hat, but that was based
on Liberty, and a lot has changed in TripleO since that time.

The first thing was learning what composable services and roles are, and
generally what they are intended to solve. I don&rsquo;t want to get into that
here, so I&rsquo;d encourage you to go read some links first and then come back here.
Additionally, it&rsquo;s assumed you know what a TripleO is :)</p></description>
