I currently work at Red Hat on the NFV (Network Functions Virtualization)
partner engineering team as the DevOps lead. In this role I work with
telecommunication partners to automate and test their NFV platforms.

In a previous life, I was an Asterisk consultant, starting professionally in
2004 (learning Asterisk in September 2002).  I'm co-author of the O'Reilly
Media published books, Asterisk: The Future of Telephony 1st and 2nd editions
(along with Jared Smith and Jim van Meggelen), Asterisk: The Definitive Guide
(3rd and 4th editions) with Jim van Meggelen and Russell Bryant, and the
Asterisk Cookbook with Russell Bryant.

As a former active member of the Asterisk community, I was the primary issue
marshal on the Asterisk issue tracker, in addition to the Asterisk release
manager. Some of the notable projects I built or implemented include:

* a distributed, fault-tolerant, and self-healing network for an ITSP
* an E911 portal for customers to update their address for their VoIP line
  utilizing SOAP
* a multi-site call centre for a job recruiting agency that allows agents to
  login to remote queues
* founder of the Asterisk Documentation Project; basis of the first edition of
  Asterisk: The Future of Telephony
* dialplan that generated IVR menus dynamically using `CURL()` function lookups
  from a remote API
* skills-based routing for `app_queue` using Local channels

I've also spoken at many Asterisk conferences, helped write the first Asterisk
training classes and dCAP (Digium Certified Asterisk Professional) training and
certification, helped to steer the implementation of several features in
Asterisk, and performed consulting for dozens of clients over the years.

Leif resides in Alliston, Ontario, Canada but has worked remotely for customers
all over the world.
