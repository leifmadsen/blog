I'll be speaking at AstriCon today (and tomorrow) about building a distributed call centre. The presentation will be 35 minutes long and will contain a set of slides that moves you from an existing traditional PBX system up through a distributed model (which happens to use a call centre as the example system).

A PDF of the presentation along with the configuration files from the demo will be available on my website after the presentation. I'll post links to the files on my blog here shortly after the presentation finishes.

Hope to see you there!
