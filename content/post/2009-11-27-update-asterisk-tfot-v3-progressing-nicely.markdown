Jim and I have been working feverishly for the past few days, and the only thing that can cure it is more cowbell! Or probably more accurately, more writing!

We've been making some good progress on rewriting a couple of chapters so far, and tweaking a few other ones. We're in the process of finishing up the first drafts of the new installation chapter and the initial configuration chapter, and I've started work on a chapter about queues. I hope to have about 50% of the queue chapter done by the end of today.

Last night Jim and myself went out to have a pint and to talk about the book, and we both realized how much our consulting experience is going to impact the quality of the book, and the ability to better define a set of best practices. I certainly think this edition of the book will surmount the quality of the first two editions, and the entire community will benefit from it. I'm really excited about it.

Hopefully we can make some good pushes over the next couple of months and get a draft of the book done early in the new year, which should set us up for a release in the spring. It's amazing how much work and time goes into creating books; the people who do this for a living are certainly a special kind of people.

Since our plan is to more openly develop the book and get the community more actively involved in the testing and proofreading of the book, I'll be sure to post an update here as soon as we have something available for reading.
