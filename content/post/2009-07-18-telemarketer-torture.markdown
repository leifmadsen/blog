A funny thing happened today. [Fred Posner](http://twitter.com/fredposner) posted an article about telemarketer torture ([here](http://www.voiptechchat.com/voip/286/asterisk-101-uses-telemarketer-torture)). He has some examples that his script created.

It was funny because today I worked on almost the exact same thing. My implementation was a bit different, but I really like the approach he took too. We both ended up using the WaitForSilence() application.

Mine should be available via [ISN](http://www.freenum.org) 666*460 if you wanna try it out.

More to follow!
