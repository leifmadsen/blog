Check out the [AstriCon](http://www.astricon.net) website for my presentation that was recorded this year. I did three presentations this year (5 Things You Didn't Know Asterisk Could Do, Distributed Call Centres, and the Asterisk Project Update with [Russell Bryant](http://www.russellbryant.net)) but unfortunately the only one I see so far is the 5 Things presentation (which is a very good presentation! :))

The link to the presentations are here:Â [http://www.astricon.net/videoPresentations.aspx#Digium7](http://www.astricon.net/videoPresentations.aspx#Digium7) with mine being at the top of the list.
