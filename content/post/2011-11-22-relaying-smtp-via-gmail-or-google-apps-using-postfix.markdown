Today I had the need to start relaying mail through my Google Apps account since <del>Super-Evil-Bastard-ITSP</del>Rogers blocks sending email (it's probably a good thing, however it's quite annoying when running some services from home).

Found this article while Googling, and it worked great first try. I like when things are this easy.
