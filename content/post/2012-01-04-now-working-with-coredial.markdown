![](https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/1509716558/twitter-coredial-square-avatar_reasonably_small.png) As of January 3rd, I'm now working with the CoreDial team full time. I've worked with them as a consultant on their infrastructure over the last few years but now will be spending significantly more time working with the engineering team :)

From the announcement,

“_CoreDial is pleased to announce the addition of Leif Madsen to the CoreDial team,” said Alan Rihm, CEO at CoreDial. “Leif is a well known Asterisk consultant who specializes in distributed telephony deployments and database integration. In addition, Leif is co-author of several O’Reilly published books on Asterisk, including Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (3rd edition). We’re pleased to be adding Leif to our team, and look forward to the exciting opportunity to work together._”

The entire announcement can be found at [http://coredial.com/asterisk-consultant-leif-madsen-joins-coredial-team/](http://coredial.com/asterisk-consultant-leif-madsen-joins-coredial-team/)

I'm really excited to be working with these guys, and to see what we'll develop over the coming months! I'll keep you informed here on my blog, and will continue to post Asterisk tidbits and snippets as I go.
