Just got my new Plantronics headset from [http://www.e4voip.com](http://www.e4voip.com) (or rather, the hardware store at [http://www.8774e4voip.com/](http://www.8774e4voip.com/)) and am extremely satisfied with the service. We had an issue with Purolator not wanting to deliver to the building and then not bothering to call me to let me know the address was incorrect. By the time I noticed and got the address corrected, they just decided to send back the package.

So after letting the guys at e4VoIP know what happened, they just drop shipped a headset via FedEx overnight and I had it by lunch the next day! Amazing service and great prices. I'm in Canada, so I know how much of a pain in the ass shipping across the border is, and usually there is a bunch of duty fees across the border, but this time around the headset didn't cost me a thing.

I plan on getting a G.722 capable phone next because now that I have this headset attached to my Polycom, I'm kind of looking forward to high quality calls during the weekly VoIP Users Conference call! ([http://www.vuc.me](http://www.vuc.me))
