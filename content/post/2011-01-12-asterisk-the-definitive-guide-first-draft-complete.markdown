Today we marked the finishing of Asterisk: The Definitive Guide (3rd Edition) by sending the first draft off to the O'Reilly production team. We finished nearly on schedule (within a few days, which is remarkable considering we added 150 more pages than originally intentioned) and have our favourite copy editor Rachel Head (formerly Wheeler) who did the first edition of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony who we emphatically enjoyed working with. We're looking forward to it again.

With the draft done now, and the copy sent off to production to do their magic, I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do with my mornings! Perhaps I'll start blogging about some dialplan stuff, or coming up with some sort of project to build. We'll see! Any suggestions about things to document on my blog are of course welcome.

Don't stop posting your comments and suggestions to the OFPS site though! (http://ofps.oreilly.com) When the O'Reilly production team is done with the book in a few weeks, we're going to have time to do additional modifications and editing, so your comments will get addressed then. It's looking like the estimated shipping date of books for March is realistic at this point.

Thanks for all the support the community has shown us this far. This is going to be by far the best book on Asterisk to date.
