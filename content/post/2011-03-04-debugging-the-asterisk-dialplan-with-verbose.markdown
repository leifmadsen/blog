In case you missed it, [Russell Bryant](http://www.russellbryant.net) wrote a blog post on [debugging the Asterisk dialplan with the Verbose() application](http://www.russellbryant.net/blog/2011/03/04/debugging-the-asterisk-dialplan-with-verbose/). This is one of the recipes that will be features in the upcoming [Asterisk Cookbook](http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920018551/) that we're writing, and hoping to have done by the end of March!

(In case you've missed all the cool stuff lately, the Asterisk Cookbook will also be released under the same Creative Commons license as the previous Asterisk books. We're also making use of the [Open Feedback Publishing System (OFPS)](http://ofps.oreilly.com) again. You can help review the text and test the recipes at [http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449303822/](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449303822/).)
