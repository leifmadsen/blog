Check out [http://leifmadsen.com](http://leifmadsen.com) and click on the presentations tab. Under that tab you will find my presentations from AstriCon 2010,  '_5 Things You Didn't Know Asterisk Could Do_' and a slightly updated version of my '_Building Distributed Queue Systems_' presentation. Both are in PDF format.

Both presentations went over extremely well, and I think both probably ended up being, or nearly being, my best presentations ever given. In previous years I've given presentations on distributed Asterisk systems and last year at IT360 I gave my  "_5 Things You Didn't Know Asterisk Could Do_" presentation, so perhaps being somewhat familiar with the format helped. I completely rewrote the '_5 Things_' chapter though, so you'll find some cool new information there if you've previously seen me give it.

The presentations were also video taped, so I'm really hoping that the AstriCon people will get those made available soon. I myself want to see if I'm just dreaming about how well I did :)
