As many of you know, I'm a co-author of [Asterisk: The Future of Telephony](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/asterisk). While my girlfriend is away in Mexico for a week with the girls, I'm going to try and focus a bunch of attention on getting A:TFoT 3rd edition started (which is much overdue).

If you have any ideas for topics you would like covered in the new edition, or something that wasn't covered as heavily as you wanted in the 1st and 2nd editions, feel free to let me know, and your ideas will be considered! I hope to get the installation chapter written today, and as things progress, we'll get them posted up on the web (likely somewhere on [http://www.asteriskdocs.org](http://www.asteriskdocs.org)) for review by the community.

We're going to try and write mostly in the open as we have things ready to go, so a more thorough community review can be done this time around rather than the closed review we've used in the past and the "get it when it's done" approach.

More information to follow in the coming week(s)!
