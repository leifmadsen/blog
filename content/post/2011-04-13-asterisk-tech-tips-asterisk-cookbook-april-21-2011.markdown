Mark your calendars! The next installment of the Asterisk Tech Tips webinar by Digium will feature Russell Bryant and myself presenting a couple of recipes from the Asterisk Cookbook. The presentation will be on April 21, 2011 at 12:00 Noon CDT (-0500 GMT).

From the blog post by Steven Sokol of Digium:

"I’m pleased to announce that Russell Bryant and Leif Madsen, two giants of the Asterisk community, will host the next [Asterisk Tech Tips](http://blogs.digium.com/2011/03/25/asterisk-tech-tips-calling-with-google/) event, scheduled for Thursday, April 21.  The dynamic duo co-authored [Asterisk Cookbook](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449303815), a new how-to filled with a laundry list of Asterisk recipes.  Russell and Leif will introduce the book and each will present their favorite recipe – live and in person!

Leif will start things up with “Hot Desking with the Asterisk Database” wherein you will learn to use AstDB (the Asterisk database) and clever Dialplan scripting to implement hot desking.  Next, Russell will present “Debugging the Asterisk Dialplan” covering the process of building a flexible Dialplan debugging system."
