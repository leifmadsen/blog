Recently Jim Van Meggelen, Russell Bryant and myself released the 3rd edition of the Asterisk book published by O'Reilly Media titled '[Asterisk: The Definitive Guide](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517342)'.

We have released this book under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) license in the spirit of Open Source software. It is available in its entirety at [http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596517342/](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596517342/) and for purchase through Amazon at [http://www.amazon.com/Asterisk-Definitive-Guide-Leif-Madsen/dp/0596517343/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1303765969&sr=8-1](http://www.amazon.com/Asterisk-Definitive-Guide-Leif-Madsen/dp/0596517343/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1303765969&sr=8-1)

If you have a chance to review the book, and feel it is a useful and well written resource, we would appreciate your favorable review on [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Asterisk-Definitive-Guide-Leif-Madsen/dp/0596517343/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1303765969&sr=8-1). One of the biggest factors in sales is favorable reviews, and with better sales comes the ability to dedicate more time to writing books like this one (which are typically written in our "free time").

Any comments, suggestions, or constructive criticisms are always welcome.

Thanks!
Leif Madsen.
