It's been way too long since I've blogged. And this post isn't going to be all the impressive unfortunately. However, I recently have been running a BBS and some friends and I have been playing LORD.

We've been playing this for the last few months, and I think I'm going to run a tournament. Perhaps with some sort of buy in like $10 or something, winner takes all.

Going to build it out in such a way that first person to beat the dragon 3 times will win the game, and at that point that person will win the pot.

Additionally, I've been reading a lot about the Go language and trying to get myself up to speed on that. Very interesting programming language. Essentially C but for concurrency (multiple processors).

I'm hoping to start blogging in the near future, but my current work has just kept me too busy and I haven't really had anything all that worth of blogging about. I hope to start changing that around soon and get back to blogging on a semi-regular basis with things I've learned in the world of telecommunications and cloud platforms / virtualization.

Additionally, I don't have any confirmation yet, but I'm pretty sure I'll be attending AstriCon in Las Vegas this year. I'm going to figure it out either way, so hopefully i can meet up with some of you this year! The last few years I've just kind of mostly kept to myself and hung out with those I've met previously. I'm going to make a better attempt at reaching out to those I haven't met before, so if you see me, come say hi please!
