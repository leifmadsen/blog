This is probably my fourth or fifth time attempting to setup a blog. Everytime I finally get something going, then either a server crashes, or some other catatrophic event that causes me to start all over again happens. So this time I'm going to use the wordpress.com site to keep my blog entirely separate of where I'm hosting my site. Hopefully this time I'll actually be able to not focus so much on administering the site, but rather spend the time actually writing!

I'll probably try and focus on many things Asterisk, then pepper some additional items that make me laugh, sad, or various other thinking items. I make no guarantees to the professionalism or political correctness of my posts, however I'll try and save you from any sort of damning photos that may haunt me in my future political career :)
