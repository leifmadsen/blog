    <h1 class="post-title">New articles coming soon!</h1>
    <p>I have vowed to try and write at least ONE article per week on my blog, even if it is quite short. I&rsquo;m not sure I will be able to get to write an article this week due to some pressing consulting issues, but I&rsquo;m still gonna try. If anything, I&rsquo;m going to cheat and say this is my post for <em>this</em> week. How about I make a rule that says I can only cheat once per month? :)</p>

<p>I wanted to let you know I have a couple of articles lined up for later this week and next week. They will deal with Asterisk Queue()&rsquo;s as that is the area I have been spending the most time lately. They include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Moving from the deprecated AgentCallbackLogin() application to a dialplan based solution</p></li>

<li><p>A series of articles (4-5 articles) on building a single system, hot-desking Agent queue system</p></li>

<li><p>The first draft of a complete re-write of chapter 3 of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first bullet point is an issue I have been seeing on IRC and other forums for about 2 years, and which I want to solve by providing the necessary documentation on how to move from using AgentCallbackLogin() to a dialplan based solution as is the preferred method. I will create a dialplan subroutine which will hopefully make it easy to replace the calls to AgentCallbackLogin() with a GoSub().</p>

<p>The second bullet point is something I&rsquo;m very excited about. I recently build a hot-desking solution for a client, and while building it was able to keep it quite general and didn&rsquo;t need to add anything that wouldn&rsquo;t be useful for the general population. I have received permission from the client (who will remain nameless for now) to utilize the configuration files I built for them in a series of articles detailing how to build the system from scratch. It is a win-win situation because you get to learn how I built the system, and they get some additional documentation on how the system works, and why things were built the way they were.</p>

<p>The third bullet point is a good deal amount of work, which is really just the start of a greater amount of work; the updating of Asterisk: The Future of Telephony, 2nd Edition, to a 3rd edition that covers the 1.6 series of Asterisk. I have recently gotten enough exposure to working with Asterisk 1.6 releases that I&rsquo;m confident in being able to start on this grandiose project. I plan on using this blog as a test bed for some draft work.</p>

<p>So stay tuned for some exciting articles over the coming 2-3 weeks!</p>
