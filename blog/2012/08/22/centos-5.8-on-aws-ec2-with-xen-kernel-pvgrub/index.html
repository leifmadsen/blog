    <h1 class="post-title">CentOS 5.8 On AWS EC2 With Xen Kernel (PVGRUB)</h1>
    <p>At <a href="http://coredial.com">CoreDial</a> we&rsquo;ve been using a lot of AWS EC2 lately for building sandbox infrastructure for testing. Part of the infrastructure is a voice platform utilizing Asterisk 1.4 and 1.8, and those voice platforms are using Zaptel and DAHDI respectively for use with MeetMe(). This hasn&rsquo;t been an issue previously as our testing has either been on bare metal, or in other virtual machine systems where installation of a base image and standard kernel are not an issue.</p>

<p>However, with the introduction of a lot of EC2 instances in our testing process, we ran into issues with building our own DAHDI RPMs since there aren&rsquo;t any EC2 kernel development packages outside of OpenSuSE (which we don&rsquo;t use). After spending a day of trying to hack around it, Kevin found a <a href="http://ec2-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/user_specified_kernels.pdf">PDF</a> from Amazon that states AWS now supports the ability to load your own kernels via PVGRUB. Great! If I can do that, then I can just continue using the same RPMs I&rsquo;d be building anyways (albeit the xen based kernel, but that&rsquo;s easy to do in the spec file).</p>

<p>Unfortunately this was not nearly as trivial and simple as it appeared at first. The first problem was that I had to figure out the correct magic kernel AKI that needed to be loaded, and the PDF wasn&rsquo;t incredibly clear about which one to use. (There is two different styles of the AKI, one called &ldquo;hd0&rdquo; and another called &ldquo;hd00&rdquo; which I&rsquo;ll get into shortly.) After searching Google and looking through several forum posts and other blogs (linked at the end), I finally found a combination that seems to work for our imported CentOS 5.8 base image. Below is a list of the steps I executed after loading up an image from our base AMI:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>yum install grub kernel-xen kernel-xen-devel</code></li>
<li><code>grub-install /dev/sda</code></li>
<li><code>cd /boot/</code></li>
<li><code>mkinitrd -f -v --allow-missing --builtin uhci-hcd --builtin ohci-hcd --builtin ehci-hcd --preload xennet --preload xenblk --preload dm-mod --preload linear --force-lvm-probe /boot/initrd-2.6.18-308.13.1.el5xen.img 2.6.18-308.13.1.el5xen</code></li>
<li><code>touch /boot/grub/menu.lst</code></li>
<li><code>cat /boot/grub/menu.lst</code></li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="language-bash">default 0
timeout 1

title EC2
     root (hd0)
     kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-308.11.1.el5xen root=/dev/sda1
     initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.18-308.11.1.el5xen.img
</code></pre>

<p>Once the changes were made to the image, I took a snapshot of the running instances volume. I then created an image from the snapshot. When creating the image, I selected a new kernel ID. The kernel ID&rsquo;s for the various zones and architectures are listed in the <a href="http://ec2-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/user_specified_kernels.pdf">PDF</a>. As our base image was CentOS 5.8 i386 in the us-east-1 zone, I had to select between either aki‐4c7d9525 or aki‐407d9529. The paragraph above seems to indicate there is a difference based on what type of machine you&rsquo;re using, and references S3 or EBS based images. We are using EBS based images, so I tried the first one, which in the end failed miserably. After reading through the <a href="http://www.ioncannon.net/system-administration/1205/installing-cent-os-5-5-on-ec2-with-the-cent-os-5-5-kernel/">IonCannon</a> blog post it became clear that the <em>hd0</em> and <em>hd00</em> AKIs are really differences in whether you have a single partition, or multiple partitions with a separate /boot/ partition.</p>

<p>With that bit of knowledge, and knowing that we only had a single partition that contained our /boot/ directory, I knew to use <strong>aki-407d9529</strong> (hd0). Another forum post also pointed out that I needed to enable some modules for the xen kernel or the system wouldn&rsquo;t boot (and I verified that by stepping through each of the steps listed above to make sure it was required). With those two major items checked off, I am now able to build an AMI that will load with a stock CentOS Xen kernel image, making it trivial to build RPMs against now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:
If you do happen to use separate partitions, make sure you use the <strong>hd00</strong> AKI. In the <strong>menu.lst</strong> you need to make sure to use <em>root (hd0,0)</em> instead of just (hd0). Additionally, your <em>menu.lst</em> file needs to live at <em>/boot/boot/grub/menu.lst</em> since AWS is going to look in the <em>/boot/grub/menu.lst</em> location on the <em>/boot/</em> partition. On a single partition the file can just live at <em>/boot/grub/menu.lst</em>.</p>

The explanation of the difference between the hd0 and hd00 AKIs was they key to my success.</p>
